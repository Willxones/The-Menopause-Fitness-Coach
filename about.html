            <br>
            <p>
              The Menopause Fitness Coach Programme has been developed by Ally Jones to address the very individual
              needs of women as we approach and go through the Menopause years. Whether you are 35 and hitting menopause
              early, or post menopause, then we need to adjust our exercises to respect the areas that have softened.
              Bringing awareness to our Pelvic Floor or connecting our core with our breathing becomes important to
              maintain an equilibrium in our bodies and stops us from feeling depleted. It’s not about training harder
              to get fit, it’s about training mindfully with respect to how you are feeling each day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many women stop exercising as we focus our energy on other priorities. Over time, we pick-up knee, hip,
              shoulder or back issues. We may gain some weight, develop batwings or hormonal tummy and lose all the
              strength in our pelvic floor, wrists and arms. As time passes, we can develop a lack of motivation and
              start to feel uncomfortable about going to a gym or having to ‘compete’ with others as we exercise.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you recognise any of these feelings, then joining the Menopause Fitness Coach community is ideal for
              you! These are transformational classes that work at your pace and to your ability. By connecting with the
              body, the sessions are designed to reduce stress, enabling you to heal, relax and even enjoy the process
              of rehabilitating your body. Joining the Live workouts with Ally helps you regain your fitness, your shape
              and your confidence, whilst having some fun and hopefully making a few friends along the way!
            </p>
            <p>
              The best bit is that it’s online so you don’t feel intimidated or embarrassed. Your energy levels are
              boosted, your stamina improves and the social interaction is powerful.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here's to finding the new fit and fabulous you, glowing with confidence & vitality!

              Holistic Well-being</h2>
            <br>
            <p class="lead">Ally Jones was born in 1969 in the UK and has always been passionate about health and
              wellness. From the
              young age of 11, Ally dreamed of owning a Health Farm. This ambition guided her through her studies and
              career choices, leading her to pursue qualifications in Social Care, Exercise, and Beauty Therapy.</p>
            <p class="lead">Ally&#39;s professional journey began in a sports centre, where she earned her British
              Weight Lifting Certificate
              (BWLA). Despite facing a significant setback with a chronic back problem and being diagnosed with
              Ankylosing
              Spondylitis, Ally&#39;s resilience saw her through extensive physiotherapy. Her determination paid off
              when she
              established her own Beauty &amp; Health Clinic within a Sports Centre, a successful venture she ran for 12
              years.</p>
            <p class="lead">Life took Ally across Denmark, Sweden, and Spain over the next 15 years. During this time,
              she had two
              children and continued to work in the Beauty and Fitness Industry. Her experiences in these countries,
              particularly training women in Crossfit and circuit training in Spain, enriched her knowledge and
              expertise.
              These international moves allowed Ally to collaborate with some of the best fitness coaches and health
              experts, significantly broadening her skill set.</p>
            <p class="lead">A pivotal moment in Ally&#39;s career came when her children developed eczema, asthma, and
              severe food
              allergies. This personal challenge led her to explore every possible treatment option, from western
              medicine to
              complementary therapies. Her 20 year journey into understanding food&#39;s impact on health was
              eye-opening,
              revealing the extent of food tampering and leading her to advocate for a high-protein, nutritious, and
              anti-
              inflammatory diet. Through diligent effort, her children overcame all health issues except for a
              persistent nut
              allergy, and Ally herself became pain-free from her back problem.</p>
            <p class="lead">In 2013, Ally returned to the UK, settling in the West Country. There, she continued her
              passion for teaching
              fitness, inspiring local mothers to join her morning exercise sessions in the park. Over the next seven
              years, she
              also operated a busy clinic, specializing in Manual Lymphatic Drainage, massage therapy, aromatherapy, and
              skincare treatments.</p>
            <p class="lead">The global shift in 2020 brought Ally&#39;s outdoor fitness classes online, expanding her
              reach to women
              worldwide. Throughout her years of training, Ally observed the profound impact of menopause on women,
              including herself. Experiencing peri-menopause in her late 40s, she dedicated herself to understanding and
              addressing the unique challenges it brings, such as pelvic floor issues and the need for joint and
              ligament
              stability.</p>
            <p class="lead">To enhance her knowledge, Ally completed a &#39;Being Breathed&#39; 40-hour training course,
              which deepened her
              understanding of the connection between diaphragms and the pelvic floor. This, combined with courses from
              the Precision Movement Academy and Fascia Stretching, enabled her to develop safer weight lifting
              techniques tailored to women navigating menopause.</p>
            <p class="lead">With over 35 years of continuous learning, Ally has cultivated a deep understanding of how
              the body functions,
              moves, and heals. Her fitness philosophy emphasizes embracing a loving relationship with one&#39;s ageing
              body,
              approaching fitness with patience, kindness, and confidence.</p>
            <p class="lead">Today, Ally uses her extensive experience to design unique fitness programmes for women,
              with men also
              benefiting from her insights into pelvic floor health. Her fun-loving and approachable manner makes
              everyone
              feel at ease, whether in group classes or one-on-one sessions.</p>
            <p class="lead">Join Ally Jones and experience the transformative benefits of her holistic approach to
              health and fitness.</p>
